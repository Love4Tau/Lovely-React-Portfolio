  ## Description
  In this project, I used react to create a responsive portfolio. The hardest part of this process was the styling for me. I had issues figuring out how I wanted my site to look. When I finallu got an idea of how I wanted the website to look, I couldn't produce good enough results, haha. The website works though! I'm going to continue to add and upgrade this website going forward.
